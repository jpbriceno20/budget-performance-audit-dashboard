# Budget Performance Audit Dashboard — Zentra Dynamics (Excel)

## Project Overview
This project simulates an executive-level **Budget vs Actual performance monitoring** solution for a mid-sized organization operating across multiple regions and departments in Canada.

The goal is to provide a **decision-ready dashboard** that helps finance and business leaders quickly identify budget deviations, cost overruns, and areas for improvement.

## Business Problem
Zentra Dynamics lacked a centralized and visual way to monitor budget execution. Reporting was fragmented and reactive, limiting visibility into:
- Which departments/regions were overspending
- What expense categories were driving variances
- How performance evolved month-over-month and YTD

## Solution
An interactive Excel dashboard built with **Power Query + Power Pivot** that enables:
- Budget vs Actual comparisons (monthly and YTD)
- Variance analysis (**$ and %**)
- Top deviation categories
- Performance flags to highlight overspending and cost-saving opportunities
- Filtering by region, department, and period

## Key Features
- Star-schema data model in Power Pivot
- Power Query transformations for clean, repeatable refresh steps
- Custom DAX measures for variance and cumulative analysis
- Executive-focused layout and clear KPI storytelling

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot)
- DAX (variance, % variance, cumulative/YTD logic)
- Data modeling (star schema)
- Financial performance analysis & executive reporting

## Repository Contents
- `dashboard/` — Final Excel dashboard file  
- `screenshots/` — Dashboard and model screenshots for quick review  
- `documentation/` — Executive summary and methodology (PDF)
