# Project Context

**Client:** Zentra Dynamics  
**Industry:** Technology & Operations  
**Project:** Budget Performance Audit  
**Tools Used:** Excel (Power Pivot & Pivot Tables)

Zentra Dynamics is a mid-sized technology firm operating across four major Canadian cities: **Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver**. The company has experienced rapid growth but lacks a clear, automated process to track **actual vs. budgeted expenses**.

Until now, financial data was siloed and manually reviewed by individual business unit managers, making it difficult to identify **overspending or underutilized resources in real time**.

This project aims to **centralize, structure, and visualize** budget versus actual performance across departments, regions, and expense categories to improve financial decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Zentra Dynamics faced limited visibility into how departments and regions were performing against their allocated budgets. Without dynamic reporting, leadership could not easily identify cost overruns or areas of efficiency.

The objective was to build a **dynamic and interactive dashboard** capable of:

- Tracking **actual spending vs. budget** by category and department  
- Highlighting **top areas with budget variance**  
- Allowing filtering by **month, department, and region**  
- Providing **quick, visual insights** to support executive decision-making
